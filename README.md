# Fuzzy Matching in Python
  If you have two Excel files and you want to match similar names or entries between them with confidence/similarity scores, you can use this fuzzy matching algorithm to complete your task.
  
  This approach is great because it automates matching similar data across files, handles inconsistencies, provides confidence scores to filter accurate matches, improves data quality, and saves time, making it perfect for large datasets and better decision-making in marketing and business analytics.
  
### Prerequisites
  pandas and thefuzz libraries are required to run this script. They can be installed using pip install "library name".

### How to run the script

  1. Name your Excel files "A_list.xlsx" and "B_list.xlsx", or you can use the test sample in the "Excel Files" folder.
  
  2. Download "fuzzymatching.py" from the "Python Scripts" folder. Navigate to the directory containing the script, then type python3 fuzzymatching.py to run it.
  
  The result you get will resemble the processed test sample named "fuzzy_matching_results.xlsx" in the "Excel Files" folder.
